# tilde_early_deadline_detector

## Description

early_deadline_detector is for early deadline detection on the specified path.

early_deadline_detector can be built in [TILDE](https://github.com/tier4/TILDE/tree/master/doc) package.

## Requirement

- ROS 2 humble
- [TILDE](https://github.com/tier4/TILDE/tree/master/doc)
- TILDE enabled application
- The Messages should have the `header.stamp` field.

## The default path for early deadline detection

The default path is shown below.

![default_path](./default_path.svg)

## Code to be changed

If you want to change the path for early deadline detection, here is a set of the parts that should be changed in tilde_early_deadline_detector.cpp.

- line 66~: All pairs of topic names included in the path and accumulated execution time must be registered. The accumulated execution time means the sum of the execution time of topics and nodes from the topic to the end of the path. The accumulated execution time can be measured using [CARET](https://github.com/tier4/caret).
- line 233~: All topic names and their MessageTrackingTags (topic) must be registered.
- line 374: The end of the path (topic) must be registered to measure end-to-end latency.

## Build

early_deadline_detector must be built in [TILDE/src](https://github.com/tier4/TILDE/tree/master/src).

Do `colcon build`. We recommend the "Release" build for performance.

```bash
colcon build --symlink-install --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

## Run

Use `ros2 run` as below.

```bash
$ source /path/to/ros/humble/setup.bash
$ source /path/to/TILDE/install/setup.bash
$ source install/setup.bash
$ ros2 run tilde_early_deadline_detector tilde_early_deadline_detector_node_exe \
    --ros-args --params-file src/tilde_early_deadline_detector/autoware_sensors.yaml
```

Here is a set of parameters.

See [autoware_sensors.yaml](autoware_sensors.yaml) for a sample parameter yaml file.

## Notification

If the target topic overruns, `deadline_notification` topic is published.
The message type is [DeadlineNotification.msg](../tilde_msg/msg/DeadlineNotification.msg).
